# ML-SLR-Predict-Salary
In this space, we will try to build a simple linear regression model with a data set comprising of employees, years of experience and salary. Based on the above data set, we will train and build a SLR model and then test it. Based on the model, we will predict the salary for a new employee based on his years of experience.
